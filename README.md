# Do Peace Agreements *Work*?

Despite three decades of research on the effectiveness of peace agreements as a means of settling civil wars, no conclusive evidence has emerged concerning their efficacy. Some research suggests that peace agreements are associated with a peaceful post-conflict environment. Other research suggests that military victories (by the government or rebel forces - research on this is also inconclusive) are associated with increased post-conflict stability. A common theme among all prior research is that it is descriptive. To date, no causal research on peace agreements and peace/violence exists. This project seeks to be the first to estimate the causal effect of peace agreements on peace. Upon the completion of this project, scholars and policymakers may finally be able to answer the question, "do peace agreements *work*?"
